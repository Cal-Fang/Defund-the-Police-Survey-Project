Education and more info,3955,Yes.  Prior to my incarceration I had no idea of the impact politics plays on the whole crime and punishment issue.  Now I understand that locking up people is one of the greatest tools a politician has to keeping himself employed at an inordinately high pay scale for mostly useless work.  Politicians spend an awful lot of money feeding other countries' incomes and helping wealthy Americans stay wealthy while bleeding the lower and middle class families' incomes dry.  They are exceptionally good at creating ways to keep incarcerated people incarcerated and growing the number of people incarcerated in order to fuel the American prison industry.  What they are clearly not willing to do is find ways to get people out of prisons and back into society as productive citizens. Kansas is a good example.  A person convicted of a murder has to perform nearly impossible feats to have any hope at all of getting out of prison alive.  Yet Lifers on average have an unbelievably lower recidivism rate than any other group. Kansas is a good example.

We put all this money into just locking people away instead of trying to invest in making them better. The money waisted on inmates that could have been given a chance to find help rather be thrown away first chance could have been put on our childrens educations, creating environments to take kids off the streets and teach them other things outside drug dealing and street husseling. We waist so much money yet none of it helps our yoitb the next generation become better then we ourselves have became."

  The world does not really care about those they put in prison, if the courts say we are guilty, then the courts must be right, then we are viewed and treated as such.
  So, when we try to do things the right way, the world treats us like we are scum of the earth.
  Politics, is just another word for greed. The government do not care about U.S.A. they only care about the money going to their pockets and looking like they are changing the world.
  They talk about being a strong country, yet the reallity of that is fake. We have more enemies then friends, and we waste military resources on petty wars that have nothing to do with us, still, I would fight for my family, if ever given the chance.

On the contrary, my experience has shown me that our government only makes it easier for individuals who have already offended to return to prison in the fashion of a revolving door. I myslfe have found that not becoming a victim of recidivism has been one of the hardest things for me after my incarceration. Granted that i did commit a crime, however, i did serve out my sentence and in turn payed my debt to society.
