3848,"I just look at things different'being incarcerated with pedofiles'rapist drug addicts of all walks of life,gives you a better veiw of the outcomes of some laws or bills passed that were supposed to help.just participating in some of the stupid programs that were suppose to change things and to listen to politicians claim they did this or that to help solve the problems when in all truth they have just implimented ignorant programs that are nothing but talking points."

684,Republican
3929,"My views regarding the criminal justice system have completely changed.  The criminal justice system is supposed to be there to seak out the truth and if necessary to provide a punishment that fits the crime.  It is not there to hand out life sentences, or effective life sentences, like they are candy.  However, or criminal justice system has been so perverted by the desire to win a conviction, or to pad the conviction rate of a county or parish, or to pad ones own status, that it is no longer about truth and justices.  As long as the prosecutor gets her conviction, she does not care about truth, right or wrong, justice or injustice.  "
6269,I have more to watch the news
4646,Personal view.

3960,"Ive come to understand that not all incarcerated people are the same and if given a Legit second chance, i believe most would have success with it."
7385,I dont feel like it matters why
7369,Majab
536,Before I voted for anyone who was ahead in the poles. But now I actually pay attention to their plan and views before supporting them. Now it could mean between freedom and staying incarcerated.

8223,Being patient has always benefitted
3148,Alot has happend here
1118,They've changed because President Trump has taken over as President and I see a lot of disrespect from the left towards him. It seems he's been attacked from day one. Regardless he's the President and people should respect him rather they agree with him or not.
4696,I was all about privateaion of everything utill i got here. For instace i am here ti serve my time to the people for what i have done. Now the people are letting corportions make money off my falts isted of the people of my state helping me fix my issues not a bottom line of a corporation who asers to stock holders not the people of my state. Take for instace the medical corizon the company here in kansas. They charge us 2 dollars for all medical help. Now how can that company stay in busness at that rate other than charge the state that pays a flat rate to them and on top of that give there staff bonuses for not spending the money provided to them for my care. That is how they make money by denining care. If i am the word of the state they are responcible not corizon. Some things should not be privatized.
3956,I ain't gonna tell you nuttin'.
7183,"Well being in a locked down facility such as the Lower Housing Unit 1 has opened my eyes to the injustice of what a person can go through even when that person be me is innocent. I dont have any kind of voice in here and have been mistreated everyday. So giving a person 22 to 26 months in whats called the """" Hole"""" for anything is strait humane torcher and inhumane. This needs addressed by our political leaders today."
4803,Yes the prison system if fucked up it needs to up graded to help inmates

3514,Yes
3595,I thought the lawmakers were fair in helping peopel be rehabilitated and pay dues and return to society.now i know the american government is not only all lies but if someone is in a political office that automatically proves they are more of a criminal and have greater potential for harm to people and americans than i ever was.

280,I used to care about what the political views were before I was incarcerated but now I see that it does not really matter because the decision in the end will only better the people out the and make things worse for us on the inside. So why should we as prisoners care anymore.

207,Laws and poltics go hand in hand. like ignorance and fear walk hand in hand. poltics is part of law and reform. money mangament is a law and legal as well as poltical thing. reglion is about leving the world better than you found it. how can this be done if your not involved in the very foundational thing that makes a nation great. the right to put what you can do into action. voting is such a thing.

29,My perspective is different
3085,Well before prison i never really cared about politics and what our leaders of the country where doing
6296,I was againt republicans now iam all about them
1940,The way the system is ran
607,"I didn't really have any political views prior to my incarceration. Now, I know we prisoners need to vote because it is the only way to hold judges and politicians accountable which will in turn protect everyone's civil rights.  Prisoners are in fact civil rights watch dogs."
4244,Yes. I now realize that the government of america is concern about its citizens whom are incarcerated. They want to help us succeed upon release. I admire donald trump for his stand on prison reform.
1134,I'm more informed
7415,Obvisously learned a grest deal more about the system in general
1139,I now see how bad the justice system is messed up
7870,[No]
275,"In my past politics had no bearing, now that I'm more in-tune; I'm also intrigued, curious and motivated to make a contribution to society."
2364,Watch more news more nitice to it
799,"I realized that my voice is more important now because I know what it means not to have it, and that it is my responsibility to make sure my interests are heard and served."

527,Yes I see a lot of stuff that effects inmates
4372,No comment
7773,[Yes] I've become more moderate as I see extremism tearing us apart.
7364,Officials dont care. I am only a number and dollar sign
5635,Because what inmates say dont count thats the way people on the out side of prison want it for inmates not to have a saying on anything on voting or anything that goes on on the outside world
1193,Since giving my life to god it has changed my view about a lot of things
8212,Yes i feel left out and be little

5310,It is where the system failsWhere the system is two-facedWhere is the real true justice in this state /world?
2882,"[Yes] My incarceration has led me to see firsthand how the judicial and political systems are taking advantage of people and their ignorance. Politicians are elected to represent us, but there are few ways for them to receive our instructions. It encourages me into activism."
4626,I have gained more knowledge in many areas of politic which I didn't have before.I have seen how being ignorant can affect ones life in these cases.
3466,Yes because voting would really make an impact on those incarcerated because it affects us
1534,Not sure

4147,I stared learning politics more
5116,"I was a firm democrat until recently. I've now become independent so to speak. I just want all the corruptness, lies, fake policies, back biting to go away. Its sad how one side accuses the other side of the same corruption their doing or have done or doing. Just do your job that your elected to do and quit pointing fingers at someone else. Stop worrying about what your counter part is doing wrong and do what your supposed to do and the united states might just get alot done the right way and in quicker fashion."
6894,"I now see the money, stress and corruption that the correction puts on this country."
4258,Treat people equally.  Spend more time in court the first time and get tjings correct
5789,I dont look at the crimale justices the same
6307,Yes
5448,They have changed gor the better towards lenancy
7574,[No]

7006,Ive been able to get a better understanding about the government
4821,I have had more time to talk about politics and have learned a lot about different views and what is actually going on in our country to help me change my views.
4727,No
5998,"I am a 10 year army veteran who once supported the legislation pretty strongly I now see a severe injustice not to races but to social classes and people who werent handed the oppurtinities that most people who write legislation have been handed. There are people affecting the lives of societies and cultures by writing and passing these laws and legislations, when in reality they could never understand how or why they are condemning good people to a life of hell all because they will never understand a dayvof struggle themselves. Its one thing to fight for a particular job or social status. Its another thing to fight for food, shelter, or sometimes your life. Direct commission to legislation shouldnt be allowed, you should only be able to affect whatvyou know."
302,"I have seen how we are used to scare the public.  The public is lied to about us. For example, they scream, """"we cannot let murderers out, they will return.""""  True statistics show recidivism for such individuals to be the lowest among released inmates, especially if they have spent a prolonged time behind bars (around 3%-5%)."
3101,[No]
5435,"I understand the thinking of,and the animosity held by non whites for white people much better than i used to.even though i disagree with some of it."
591,Cause I was so young when I got locked up that I didn't have a view cause it didn't matter to me now it does I see what is going on in my country and I want a say in it and if I don't vote to try to change things then I shouldn't have the right to complain about what is happening if I'm not willing to help change things.
2707,[No]
5146,"My political views have changed since I have been incarcerated because through self-discovery into my own issues that lead me to prison & the recovery process, I have become very interested in the problems our country is faced with & solutions to these issues that involves all of us, especially the issues that involve crime & punishment. Many of these issues can be resolved in the rearing of our children. I had anger issues associated with a traumatic childhood & very dysfunctional parents. Mant times I sought help with authorities who turned a blind eye. My psychological & emotional issues lead me down the path of antisocial behavioral patterns. I was bullied, beaten & tormented for years by abusive parents. I understand why people who are damaged & hurting can be hurtful to others, wanting others to feel rhe pain & suffering they feel inside. This is a serious problem facing this country, not only from the innocent lives destroyed in our schools & neighborhoods but the social & economic issues facing this c"
5956,Ya
1005,The law's and our voting rights.
7868,[Yes] I have been incarcerated for 9 years and have seen people get a lot of time for small things & people get no time for big things. People comming back over & over again. Something needs to change
7502,"[Yes] They have gotten broader and I know that their are really no lines. You vote along your moral and situational lines. Whats best for you and your family ""generally"" drives your thinking."
1267,They havnt changed
2425,Never use to care
7934,Yes. I really believe every vote counts and we as a free country should really be voicing our oppinions on a ballot.
4396,Mnn
5346,Prison reform.
232,By the way to look at things
7091,Watched the political rollercoaster all these years. Too many minorities filling jails and prisons.
7593,"As we become more informed, hopefully we evolve; as does our views."
7526,[No]
4984,"I used to believe Democrats were the ideal system, now I don't. I think government is too involved in individuals lives and democrats are restricting the individual's right and freedoms too much."
5608,"The system is a business,that has private interest and fails to acknowledge the real issues that lie under the surface.The corporations and their contracts fail to actually help or rehab us correctly.The """"post release"""" is a constituional violation(5th amend)used to reincarcerate the felon who never gets a chance to challenge the parole contract."
3031,Yes
7197,Yes it makes me think that people in politics actually see us as humans
5461,"Because i see the truth!!!!! I've grew up in facilities since i was 12 iam now 38. I used to not care about politic's because i never knew or understood there meaning or importants, as i know is the same for many here now and to the one's the system is grabbing at young ages now. They will only know this cause people come here and are forgotten. Until they come to a point of inlightenment with time and see people do care people want to help! That we matter and our struggles matter to society that its the people we elect to power that are for what ever reasons not doing or are not being allowed to make changes people want. And some people are not fully awear of truths of incarceration and vote on half truths like oh let's be nice to people who broke the law. Truth is we ecxcept our punishments but also want help to be better people and help society become safer and better for all people. "
1401,I didn't listen to or watch politics before I got incarcerated but after seeing the injustice in the system firsthand it made me want to learn more about the people who make our laws
5531,"I used to hate politics and politicians equally.  Now, because of the flagrant hypocrisy of the Democrats, I definately have come to hate them more.  They preach tolerance but at the same time aggressively attack those who represent views contrary to their own.  They are also sending very bad mixed messages to children.  Telling them bullying people is wrong but relentlessly attacking the president and sometimes his family."
108,I'm More willing to listen to opposing views now.w
1673,Because you never know what will happen
7493,I had no views prior to incarceration; now I believe in certain core beliefs of left & right wings
1197,There are certain laws and political views that never applied to me before
3924,"I realize that our country is pretty messed up, and the radicalized lefties are worried about the wrong things."
6734,No
7560,"[Yes] System is broken shattered, but I figure it out along with cycle this time, Along with moral & values of my life"
6530,"I.dxeuwduh,"
5989,Strongly decisive
4269,Well now instead of voting for borders we need to focuss on fixing the problems with sending kansas inmates to out of state privately owned human impounds
655,I think differently on fairness for felons as well as first timers
1535,You see things for what they are
1262,No one Care about the people that's locked up.
745,Before I didn't care about prisoners reform
4707,Yes because everything is considered for us people
1061,Don't have one
2090,"Prison is a waste resorces and human lives, over half of the inmates in here are non-violent drug users and given no chance at treatment.....It's B.S."
3770,To be honest yes it has changed my political views in the regard that i am so much more informed now. I dont just listen to what others say i am able to do my researh and to learn truely like in the current presidential debates what the canidates for persident really stand for and even more so what i stand for and what i believe we as a country stand for untied
7048,Yes because im a gang member
3351,"I have given far more attention to what is transpiring regarding this nation, each state, and those in office, and their main force/goal for why they are running.  What they accomplish, if anything.  I listen and pay close attention and pray for this country far more than before coming here.  I have been stirred like never before to work for the betterment of this nation and the generations to follow."
3007,[No] I am still an independent because there are pros and cons to both major political parties and I believe in the right to vote for both parties for the issues that I am concerned with.
5119,"I've always thought that laws are essential to our society.  I believe in the punishment for breaking the laws.  What I don't think is right, fair, or just, is the disparity in sentencing, or allowing the actions of some who continue to do wrong to cause harsher treatments on everyone.  There is no one concerned with how the prison systems are ran, and how inmates and their families are exploited and taken advantage of by the system.  We have no one concerned with the lack of programs and preparing offenders for release.  We need politicians who are up to date and willing to fix a system that is being ran by some people who are doing the same things some offenders did to get put in here."
7919,I feel like im being shut out.because of my stupid mistakes.i have made...
4203,I used to not care but now i pay attention and care
3456,I feel that I pay more attention to the issues going on and to the overcrowding of prisons.
7089,Had more time to pay attention.
2063,Probation are liars and full of shit
166,Because my life has chang I can see what  life is really about now
128,Yes now I understand how to make a difference starting with myself first. I have always been told I could not vote and I know that is a lie. I want to have a say so in who should be in what office. I want to vote for people that will make changes for the people and not for there benefit.
6714,Yes! We look at things diffent now than before
6992,"I used to believe in America, now I see its a evil place that is run by the real criminals and crooks, murderers, and dope dealers."
7747,The was is the
310,I am now a Christian and against abortion and against gay rights and against gun control and government handouts. I also know about the corruption in the Dept of Corrections and the corrupt prosecutors and police. I am NOT a disgruntled inmate. That's not why I say these things!
3795,Because I feel that I have more empathy for people who are struggling and a greater understanding of what it feels like to have no say in the world around you. Also I have had alot of time to think on my own ideas of solutions to issues like prison reform.
1126,Yes becouse I feel nonviolent offenders should be heard.
6512,Since being incarerated ive been paying more attention to the.news since i cant vote or voice.my.opinion in public
2353,Cuz alot.of people give me ideas
6957,"I was never into politics, nor truly understood them. Now, I'm better educated and understand that it is very important to know about this."
4659,Are voices are not heard
137,Because there's no political voice speaking up for the incarcerated
5644,"I can't vote, it doesn't pertain to a right I don't have."
7242,I see how the jugdes break the law and you cant do anything
7776,[No]
7566,Na
6660,Because i look at every voice count and every vote count
6805,"I am now aware of the profit motivated """"get tough on crime"""" bullshit that came out of administrations from both sides in the '90s, and am far more independant in my political views."
1784,No change
6334,I watch things unfold more clearly in prison then i do when im all busy amd working on the streets
4271,Because they will throw anyone in prison
6604,"The things i have seen and witnessed has been eyeopening. There is so much corruption when it comes to us. I want to accept the fact that there are people who want to represent our country who wants to help us. And everytime we get our hope up, the lying begins."
3082,Since watching the news all racial status has change alot
87,I seen how much my voice can be a factor in elections
3846,This place was an opportunity to educate myself in the means of governing the people. Back then before my incarceration the views i held were based on feeling. Now my views are based on reality.
3910,All the demacrates
774,Idk
4432,Before getting locked up i never really thought about politics. Since being incarcerated i watch the news every day and i speak to to my sister about politics. My understanding is much better now.
7282,Prison reform and inmate rehabilitatiom
1798,I really get to see what's going on in the world
1099,It seems that everything's agents people locked up
1344,Yes because I keep up with the news more and trump is doing a really good job
4603,"Yes because i am a person thats incarcerated that has changed but with me being in the system since i was 18 an now im 29, prison reform could of helped me years ago but it was never a topic of discussion. The things i have seen an how i was treated instead of helped thru out my time, just motivated me to push thru to get my high school diploma which in the beginnig of my time they kept telling me that my sentence was too long for me to get my diploma an its now 2019 i finally was able to apply myself an get. I can only imagine the inmates that dont have the motivation to keep focus or the opportunity to better they self because the system in 2019 still has no opportunities or the people with the mindset or the training to help the people thats incarcerated. So whoever read this please help us."
7066,Being incarcerated gives me more time to pay attention to what is going on in the world and to give it serious consideration.
3972,Well i have been incarcerated since i was twenty years old and before then i voted for Obama basically because i wanted him to be the first black president and people were comparing him to Mlk so i wanted to vote because of that it was the first and last time i voted im older now and maturer the things that i look for in a canidate. are a lot wider now i could care less whether your black white or blue i just someone who will.be commited to prison reform and restoration of broken families and be more susceptable to the idea of a prisoner who can change
6587,As you grow your views change with the time.
1116,I have a different mind frame about it now
3640,"Prior to my incarseration I was not as simpathetic to people in prison or jail, now I see how easy one can be placed in this inviroment for the simplist of crimes. Yes hold people accountable, but once the trial has been conpleated let people get on with their lives. And stop for profit and privativing prisons."
7005,I was incarcerated when i was 16 so i didnt really have any political views
6031,I've gotten older and follow it a little more younger people don't are as much
609,I used to have a lot more faith in our government and it's ability to solve issues for the common man. But now I see that it's more about them talking about what they CAN do than actually DOING them
3320,Idk
1347,In order for our free world society to change or Uprise for the betterment of our youth that will carryout the Final results of our future
2102,Because u get a different view of how it is on the inside
5775,I used to not be politically persuaded or interested either way. Since being incarcerated I have started listenting to NPR and BBC World Service and have developed my political opinions.
4968,Because i start to see that they dont have my best instrest at hand
1272,Now I'm even more affected by policies that place complete control over my circumstances.
4958,I dont think anyone cares
2951,[Yes] I now see the need for prison reform from the inside
4089,"Being in Prison has shown me that the system for rehabilitation reform for inmates to law abiding citizens is in fact not at all accurate, matter of factly its worse people in charge only care for the price that comes a long with our charges. We need to focus on reforming the prison system to create better resources so upon release the inmates are well versed and knowledgable about society"
6054,I wanna have a effect on my community
5432,I've been incarcerated since 2009 and ever since obama was elected was when I started to show an interest in politics.Ever since Trump has been elected to office and the impeachment alligations my views have drastically changed.
470,"Being incarcerated it makes you pay more attention to the things going on in the Judicial system that affects you/ Me. I am force to dig into history and see what has worked, what has failed, what political party made the most rehabilitative advances, and go with them."
646,No
1990,Yes
63,I have come to be more libertarian in my outlook on politics.
3723,New perspective
5675,Becuse of the charge I was given.
111,The President has really done good job what he has done
4196,Well after becoming informed my political stance has changed from democratic to republican due to my understanding of our worlds economic situation in america being greatly affected by our abuse of government aide.
1379,I believe that the person who is is voted in should have to visit all the prison in the United States or at least spent some time in the system so they will actually know what we the incarated people go through.
4988,"I have the realization that my every inclination is held refuted reflected or refined by the very world ,government , or domain I choose to live in with or by ,as a result of the American voterAccording to my American lifestyle amongst the U.S.A."
6678,While locked up you pay more attention to world problems
4315,THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE HERE AND PROBABLY NEVER GET OUT WHILE THERE IS SOME GUYS THAT JUST NEED HELP WITH MAYBE A DRUG PROBLEM. OR SO ON
6633,I should of said no to that last question. I still dont trust people in politics.
1219,Never paid attention while outside
5883,Its all a scam it dont matter if i vote or not trump paid his way even know hillary hqd more votes its all a fucking scam
5672,It doesnt matter.
4865,"I love trump and all he has done,and what he still could do."
1250,"Prior to my incarceration I was indifferent, I didn't have a reason to care now I care deeply because I am effected so personally"
3019,It does matter who is elected.
6745,Trump
447,"Trump says a lot of incorrect, off the wall stuff but he knows how to get stuff done and of course hisc accomplishments do speak for themselves."
6465,It has made me open my eyes to the all around corruption of the political system.
5556,Well everyone grows and changes there mind from time to time
7068,Stupid polititions
7026,I think donald trump is the best president.we have ever.had
5388,I am.more.educated and mature. I had to do my own personal research into my beliefs and i have a better understanding on things.
2794,[Yes] I can now idenify with the racial bias in the criminal justice system in the state of Florida
2896,[Yes] I was not as empathetic for people who struggled with substance abuse and disempowerment. That has changed.
5122,I have become.more aware of political divirsities
4990,No
3331,Nope
338,I never thought about prison before.
3098,I have become more aware of politics and my interaction with the goverment in recent years.
7518,[No]
5148,More interested in politics that affect incarcerated persons especially older inmates - i am 64.
7226,"I have learned that Democrats are Pro-government and anti-gun. I believe in my freedom as an American as well as my Right to bare arms. If a party is any sort against me having my freedom or against me and my Right to bare arms, I will NOT vote or stand up for a Presidential canadit that supports any of these things."
1039,My option matters also
7501,[Yes] I feel more strongly about voting - being I never had the chance before! And I know our voice at the polls could make great strides!
3350,"Watching the news and really gaining a sense of what's going on in this country, is a huge motivation to anyone who want better for the country their living in, especially if it could possibly effect them personally in some type of way or another"
6393,No comment
4465,I feel like everyone locked up should have a chance to vote
1674,Yes because no matter who you vote for most of them tell the American people what they think they want to hear and as for the presidential race they lie to the people about how important their vote is when in actuality it means very little because in the last election Hillary Clinton received more popular votes than Trump but the electoral college elected Trump so why don't they tell the people that even if you don't come out and stand in the rain and freezing weather a president is still going to be elected.
3688,I pay more attention to whats going on in the world
4640,I didnt have an opinion before nor an interest
377,Before being locked l had no interest in politics
150,I was very young when I got locked up as I have gotten older and watched how horribly wrong everything has gotten out there it has made me want to get involved and learn more so when I get my second chance I will be able to make a difference
4837,"I didn't think they were that important but i realized that """"Voting"""" especially our votes can promote our wishes of wanting a person in office that we believe will reform the judicial system properly into giving certain crimes and circumstances lesser punishments and not using a criminal history against them! "
808,"My view about the prison system in Arkansas is against the system that suppose to help me and make me a better person. The people we vote in do not care about us who has a lot of time or little, they just lock us up and make us work for free while they make money off us and our families. We should get paid and training and education and life skills no matter how much time we got to do."
6606,"I understand the need for rehabilitational programs that will help people to be able to fit back into their communities once released, and we need like-minded politicians in power to aid this."
2170,I don't know
2930,[Yes] Because of the conditions in which we are made to live under this has changed my view of politics all together
7529,"[Yes] Although I am a Democrat, I notice that republicans are not so bad. That political view came from the conflict the state versus Federal. Something I did not know. I assume it was all one-together but different branches."
3416,I now realize how unfair the justice sytem is and how bad it is for those of us incarcerated
1495,I'm a victim of a corrupt justice system I now realize the importance of justice reform in my state and American is
2351,No
6654,"Well, before my coming to prison I disliked all law enforcement. As ive grown ive come to look at thing a lot differently. I choose to view things through others eyes and understand where they're coming from."
7718,Watch news more often
7036,I dont see no change from any one in the whithouse
3044,Don't know
7335,I hope God puts political were they need to be
3045,Shorter sentences for drug offences and longer for violent crimes and gang activity
1180,More towards less government control
946,Since being incarcerated my political views have changed a lot because I now realize that having committed an offense is why I am incarcerated. But not being afforded the opportunity to reform or get out is a systematic processed implemented by governingOfficials and private businessman who are profiting from my being incarcerated.
753,I was never interested in government or the laws before I got incarcerated but after being incarcerated for over two decades I see how important it is to vote the right lawmakers into office.
2101,Have
263,Because after being sent to prison I see on a daily basis how people on the inside of prisons get treated. It's almost a constant beat down instead uplifting and letting people change and being able to change and get a second chance in life. Sometimes people are forced into situations or drug use puts them into situations that you would not think of doing under normal circumstance. I believe anyone can change no matter what they have done in there past and will not repeat the same behavior in the future.
1464,"I think I should pay more attention to what goes on in the political class because as it happens, it directly effects myselfna my family."
953,"Severe corruption needs to be removed from sheriff's/police, county prociutors ,judges ,tax collection official 's they are not above the law!"
366,I wasn't thinking bout none of the political conversations in the world cause I didn't understand how important they were
213,I used to be mostly liberal now I'm conservative
8261,[Yes] Im not against mass incarceration. People should not be sent to prison for every little reason. The justice system is broken.
8248,Ive become aware of massive corruption inherent in the system.
195,"Before I was sentenced to prison, I was pro-death sentence. Now I see the problems with the system and I have no faith in them to get it right."
3587,"Laws Regulations,Customs,Policies,Ksa,leadership needs to change for favor for the poor"
8053,I have grown more interested in how our goverment works and wish to learn more
2108,"When i was not in jail i wasn't informed on whats going on in the world, now i read the paper as much as possible because i like to know whats going on."
4653,This system is such a waste and does so very little to prepare anyone to return to society especially financially and sets parolees up for failure without any money.
1140,I wanna vote
6647,I now know more
4690,Feel we lose some rights
583,"Now that I can view politics from being a convicted felon, I can now see the lack of understanding or care for incarcerated individuals."
1985,I dont know.
709,Time
3871,Well because of me haveing more time to think
3777,Theyve changed because I can now see or now I pay attention to what is going on around me and how politics are now affecting prisons
1893,Because of the justice reform
7511,[No]
5720,I was only seventeen when I came to prison so I never had a political standing until coming in. Now I am more involved with politics and what happens to the country because it keeps me up to date on the outside world
2126,Peace
6811,Ive payed more attention to polotics.
4519,"I never had an intrest,now that has changed."
6735,Ive realized that anyone who has been elected has not cared or tried to help the incarcerated. I believe there should be other programs that help the root problems of why we commit crimes
4008,"I see voting as a right and should not be a previlage, I see people for who they are amd in order to have a voice, you have to vote a closed mouth cant get feed. I need to share my portion I need to be heard."
2532,I believe more prison reform ahould happen too many people are locked up for corrwetable thibgs
3652,I rather not say.
2732,[Yes] Have learned to read observe and study more on the functions of politics. Especially this process of impeachment
6249,Yes because i understand a little bit now apose to befor i didnt.
6425,They treat sex offernders like shit when it is the least likely to reoffend to any other crime
6474,I now know more about the prison industrial complex
4859,I now tend to see how much electing the right people can efect change nnation wide and localy
6036,Because i want my country to get a right president
260,I know now people just say what we want to here
2087,I feel that if people like myself n
431,"I see that I used to think """"black and white"""" and now over time I think political people make a lot of criminals the way they are"
2514,Want to pay more attention.to wahats goingon in the world.and localy
352,They changed because being incarcerated made me pay more attention to what's going on in the country and how much policy truely affects every person no matter where you are.
3679,Just have put my self around people i usually would not bein around an have herd all different views an beliefs so kinda opens the mind up
5286,NO
2931,[Yes] Because I have been more intuned with the voting on the 65% passing in Florida.
3675,It all about money and prower no mater the cots
625,I care more now that I know more.
183,Becca Trump is out of there
155,"I could have cared less about politics when I was younger. Now I pay more attention to the news and believe that I am better informed to make the decision that I could care less about the politicians that are entrusted with the responsibility of taking care of our country. And we as a country wear our feelings too much on our """"sleeve""""."
7855,[Yes] you have to live it to know it - and I live it every day - we all have a story - and need to be heard - it is the smallest crimes causes the longest time - so I have to fight for me + others
6370,The prison dictates our actions
2879,"[Yes] Never had any before nor did I pay much, if any, attention to current events."
1370,Not
1936,No
525,Don't know
4261,"I use to be ignorant with my views as i didn't really look at the issues, i looked at the politicians who would talk as to whether they seemed trustworthy, i now pay attention to the issues and not who is speaking, i do what homework i can."
923,None
198,I was not very interested in politics when I was not incarceratedNow I am
274,I have become consciously awaken.
7515,"[Yes] I never paid attention to politics after the 2 Bush terms. Then Obama came into office and I see the shift and started to pay close attention. Now with Trump, I'm more focus."
3714,No
7297,I think human trafficing is a crime cummited by the judishel system. Cops to judges
455,Am not free
7109,"As a prisoner befoe i tusted in the law where you did your crime you do the time,however,continuing to keep prisoners locked up past their discharge dates is unethical and wrong."
7647,Yes am very depressed
1021,I see how messed up prison systems are from the state level now
562,"I no longer believe in the judicial system, especially Arkansas. I don't believe in the sentencing guidelines, nor the correctional system in Arkansas. I feel all states should be equal in their sentencing and politically no one looks into Arkansas and their outdated laws and mandates."
472,"I went from being a casual observer, to doing in depth studying and research and coming to the conclusion that I was a independent moderate. I believe in balance and compromise. I agree with the Conservative platform of being fiscally responsible, lowering taxes, and keeping government out of our everyday life however I disagree with the Conservative ideology of (pulling yourself up by your bootstraps) because there are situations when people do need a hand up and not necessarily a hand out. I somewhat disagree on their economical concept of (the trickle down effect). Stats have repeatedly shown that when corporations do good profits go to the stock holders and board members and not so much to the everyday working class average Joe. I agree with the Liberal platform of government correcting the abuses of society but not so much in leftist platform of tearing down the government and starting completely over.  Since then my political views have changed even more. I now identity myself as a Liberal Democrat. The"
3407,"I used to be strictly partisan, but now that I understand how important it is to work across the aisle I've taken a different approach to listening to government officials and their views on problems facing our country. I registered to vote as a Democrat, but now I think that I am more of an independent."
4250,I now have God in my life and many of my views have changed
5732,Sls
4511,I have been watching a lilltle more pn politics then i was on the streets
6521,I dont give a fuck
7,I never considered the prison population or prison reform before i came here.  Plus i never considered socioeconomic issues that predisposed people to become incarcerated
5295,Oh ya you find out who your friends are.....
1360,I didn't know how broken the justice system was until I was in it.
7073,"Well i have done a lot of wrong as a criminal yes but i have to get bunished or repremanded for my wrong , when the goverment or goverment enntities do wrong they get away with it like ellgal revokationb becase a laywer can not give input on parole hearrings only to over see so as the mojority politacal strong suite they do as they feel"
5613,The in-fighting between parties
103,Before incarceration I was too busy with my addictions and my own problems to care. Since having had time to slow down without worldly distraction I have come to understand that this is not okay and it is very important for me to care and to teach my children to care.
2409,I USE TO NOT CARE AT ALL ABOUT POLITICAL DRAMA. BUT SINCE MY LAST INCARCERATION I STARTED TAKING AN INTEREST.
6881,"My political views have changed in the fact i'm becoming more aware of how the governments (state,federal) are interacting with my situation of being locked up in the penological system and how who is in the whitehouse can have a dramatic effect on the people incarcerated. "
5249,We need a better justice system and people who care
5075,No
6130,Yes because its the first time ive head my head clean and had more time to follow.
5333,I hate my country now
1675,I want freedom
2775,I have now had the experience to treatment of D.O.C. and I tell that more should be done to help inmates on the inside & outside.
3942,I used to not care about who was president as long as they did it with integrity and responsibly. Now I would like to see president reunite this country to achieve great things.
3005,[Yes]
3355,"Well when i was free, i didnt think very much about politics. It was not until i got incarcerated that i realizzed that now that i have to register for the rest of my life that i know now that politics are going to effect me very much so now"
1894,A lot that I am aware of
6477,I wach the news more
7894,[Yes] Because you actually get to see the results of what laws are passed that effect Human Rights of individuals incarcerated
4700,"I have become more aware of the political world, which has allowed me to become more open minded about certain situations. "
4360,"Our gorvernment Officals in regards to all positions should always be focused on making America better in all areas.Rather its jobs,education,more good time for prisoners,more helping programs to prepare prisoners to be civilized residents in their communities,regardless of race...It should always be helping the America Nation better."
7573,[Yes] The 13th Amendment says it all.....
4930,I never thought about voting before because I really didn't care about politics and I didn't think it affected me at all.Now I see that it affects me more than I thought.
1459,I've had a lot of time to sit down watch the news and get a better understanding of what's happening in the world
3285,I've experinced being treated unfairly because im black
116,I didn't really have a political view or I.Q. before coming to prison. I just never paid attention to that issue.
4283,I thought that the system was out to help when i first got in trouble when i was 19. I soon found that was not the case at all. Later in life i became good good friends with a lawyer who told my that the government was fouled in so many ways. Alot of the laws set into place come along after something has happened to a politition like a house or state rep so that they get to keep their seat. But it affects those lower in standing diffrently.  He sat and told me that most lawyers have a quota of people that they must make deals with. For example he would plead my out to a lenghty sentence in prison so that the son of the local DA could get 6 months probation. Then the revolving door begins to move again for those of us who want to do goos in society we are now labled and marked. Even if the laws.were changed it still dont help the real issues.The fact the the system is seriously%$&#ed up.The people who set the laws.in motion are always wanting to make more and more money and will lie to do so.Why dont the
6230,Yes it has because I now can see how people of color get.treated compare to white folks not just in prison but outside as well
4278,Yes alot
5038,"What has politicians done for the criminal.minded accept keep people mentally incarcerated? D.o.c does not stand for department of corrections, it stand for departmemt of corruption. There isn't any reform or rehabilitation for offenders. We are locked away and then forgotten. "
4171,Its whatever
4469,Cause i see the need.to reform prison
3666,I am more aware now' i am older.
273,I care about who is in charge
7361,I have paid attention more to the government and political issues on the news and tv.
5164,It''really''havent'''changed'much1
5968,Does not bother me
8233,"Yes,I think its unfair for inmates who are incarcerated who are citizans of the USA,DONT GET TO VOTE,I feel strongly that no matter what are charges if weve done are time and are changing are ways,I feel we should get to vote because it could make a difference.we have a voice,are charges dont define us"
6122,I  have learned to hate all polititions equally.
4874,No sex labels no parole no kasper and NO REGISTRATION.
6688,I am more in supportcof border control and deportation of illegal immigrants.
7202,Yes
6709,"Being incaracerated opens ones eyes to alot of thing never thought about before, like pruson reform."
6494,Before.being incarcerated i didnt even pay attention to politics but talking with others and watching the.news.it has.peaked.my interest
1018,I think most of the older cases should be retried and people with drug offense's should get the correct treatment
14,I dont have a view
4796,"I have had more time to become informed.Also because i am trying to make the world a better place, anyway i can.Being incarcerated showed me how fucked up things really are in this country...Somethings NEED to change. I never knew growing up that the government allows the terrible things that happen to us. Then the system systematically silences our voices through the corruption of low level DOC officals for various reasons..."
1485,I see how corruption actually happens
7268,"Being politicaly engaged at every level posable is more important than ever to me. Not only for my own soul, but for the preservation of all that is good. Freedom is not free, and the maintainance of it is certinaly not by ignorance or apathy."
5879,By having a voice
6454,I focus more on what someone stands for and what they are trying to do and where they get there infomation
3354,I am more informed on certain issues. I never paid attention before.
129,Being Locked up gives you  different perspective
608,The change I feel it that both party's are wrong with there view points
7140,I feel like its just a show of polical class and how they want to suduce the normal population into voting for them to create a nation of their beliefs and laws and not the ideals or the pursuit of happiness of their individual freedom to obtain each citizens own American Dream.
2783,[No]
3444,"Well, being on the inside looking out, i can see now where our economy is based on a background judgement and if this country is supposed to be based on freedom and second chances, then why is so hard for the majority of society to grant these seconds chances to people who could have simple made a poor judgement choice or had a bad day?"
7027,"I've become more informed of the political climate and what is happening to this country as time goes by. Honestly, I think that only comes from age, though, not being incarcerated."
2812,[Yes] I think more about reform of the system
2014,No
3797,I have gotten to experience another dimension of where part of the population resides.
5637,My view of the world has shifted. I now know what its like to be on this side.
4496,Ive become more conservative
1230,I can't
8064,Yes it has because i didt use to give a flying motherfuck. Now i do.
1273,I can sit down an watch it more now
6044,I have had more time to study are political office
3881,"Before my incarsiration I was a die hard democrat. Now, several years later, I know my party identification is solely Republican"
6846,I just see a different side of things
289,"Before I was locked up, I really didn't pay attention to the news and the political arenas. Now that I have""""more time"""" to watch the news, I am more concerned and opinionated"
