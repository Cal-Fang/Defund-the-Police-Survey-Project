On the contrary, my experience has shown me that our government only makes it easier for individuals who have already offended to return to prison in the fashion of a revolving door. I myslfe have found that not becoming a victim of recidivism has been one of the hardest things for me after my incarceration. Granted that i did commit a crime, however, i did serve out my sentence and in turn payed my debt to society.

Plus those that want to educate themself like me getting my accociate degree. Buti cant afford every class nor when i get out will i have much to start over on. Right now they act racist agaist certain cases for what to not let them be able to have a chance in life. Some cases like mine if they had investigated at the first i wouldnt be here now.

699,More interested,5436,"  I never really cared about politics while I was a free man, but being in prison has opened my eyes to the reallities of the world.
  The world does not really care about those they put in prison, if the courts say we are guilty, then the courts must be right, then we are viewed and treated as such.
  So, when we try to do things the right way, the world treats us like we are scum of the earth.
  Politics, is just another word for greed. The government do not care about U.S.A. they only care about the money going to their pockets and looking like they are changing the world.
  They talk about being a strong country, yet the reallity of that is fake. We have more enemies then friends, and we waste military resources on petty wars that have nothing to do with us, still, I would fight for my family, if ever given the chance.

Now, though, after 23 years in prison, I realize how greatly I'm affected by the laws and the political climate.  I have spent years as a Paralegal (from a Blackstone Legal Assistant certification) researching the law and standing up for civil liberties of incarcerated men like myself.  I have a case in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals number 19-1995 challenging Arkansas' use of unpaid prisoner labor as unconstitutional because 45 (or 48 depending on the source) other states pay their prisoners for labor.
