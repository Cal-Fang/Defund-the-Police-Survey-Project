516,More interested,1074,"I was incarcerated in 1996, five months after I turned 21 years old, and I didn't care about voting then.  I was too wrapped up in using substances to dull my emotonal pain from childhood trauma to worry about having political views or being civic-minded.  Now, though, after 23 years in prison, I realize how greatly I'm affected by the laws and the political climate.  I have spent years as a Paralegal (from a Blackstone Legal Assistant certification) researching the law and standing up for civil liberties of incarcerated men like myself.  I have a case in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals number 19-1995 challenging Arkansas' use of unpaid prisoner labor as unconstitutional because 45 (or 48 depending on the source) other states pay their prisoners for labor.  I also have a lawsuit challenging the prison mail policy as violative of the Arkansas Constitution's equivalent of the 1st Amendment.  Before I came to prison, I wouldn't have even known about these issues or cared about another man's civil liberties, but"

They should be looking at root causes and how to help, and i mean real help not the kind that just looks good on paper. People should be being prepared to go back out into communities from the first day they walk through prison doors.

Locking people up and throwing away the key no matter what they have done is not the answer and we have created big bussiness from this. Instead of being people we have become less than human and money on the foot.

There are other issues with this that i would be more than happy to talk to someone with."
165,Experience related to prison or justice system,7799,Ive seen alot of heabus corpus
434,Education and more info,3955,Yes.  Prior to my incarceration I had no idea of the impact politics plays on the whole crime and punishment issue.  Now I understand that locking up people is one of the greatest tools a politician has to keeping himself employed at an inordinately high pay scale for mostly useless work.  Politicians spend an awful lot of money feeding other countries' incomes and helping wealthy Americans stay wealthy while bleeding the lower and middle class families' incomes dry.  They are exceptionally good at creating ways to keep incarcerated people incarcerated and growing the number of people incarcerated in order to fuel the American prison industry.  What they are clearly not willing to do is find ways to get people out of prisons and back into society as productive citizens. Kansas is a good example.  A person convicted of a murder has to perform nearly impossible feats to have any hope at all of getting out of prison alive.  Yet Lifers on average have an unbelievably lower recidivism rate than any other group. Kansas is a good example.

468,Need for change in system,3434,"People being incarserated for one. People with the crimes of rape, child molestation, and murder get less crimes then people with drug charges. There isn't enough rehabilitation out there people such as Judges, DA, and even higher in rank are just quick to throw away the key rather then help. We put all this money into just locking people away instead of trying to invest in making them better. The money waisted on inmates that could have been given a chance to find help rather be thrown away first chance could have been put on our childrens educations, creating environments to take kids off the streets and teach them other things outside drug dealing and street husseling. We waist so much money yet none of it helps our yoitb the next generation become better then we ourselves have became."
