Politicians spend an awful lot of money feeding other countries' incomes and helping wealthy Americans stay wealthy while bleeding the lower and middle class families' incomes dry.  They are exceptionally good at creating ways to keep incarcerated people incarcerated and growing the number of people incarcerated in order to fuel the American prison industry.  What they are clearly not willing to do is find ways to get people out of prisons and back into society as productive citizens. Kansas is a good example.  A person convicted of a murder has to perform nearly impossible feats to have any hope at all of getting out of prison alive.  Yet Lifers on average have an unbelievably lower recidivism rate than any other group. Kansas is a good example.
