I am sad to say that my experience has shown me that our legal system is flawed down to its foundation, and in turn i hold little faith in the justice system and its abillity to rehabilitate and re-incorporate individuals into society. On the contrary, my experience has shown me that our government only makes it easier for individuals who have already offended to return to prison in the fashion of a revolving door. I myslfe have found that not becoming a victim of recidivism has been one of the hardest things for me after my incarceration. Granted that i did commit a crime, however, i did serve out my sentence and in turn payed my debt to society. I dont feel that it is fair for me or so many others like me to have to be at a disadvantage in terms of inequality because of our past mistakes.

Pay our childsupport and help our children on the out side. The crime would go down. Things in here like rofw bib leadership toast masters all can help. Plus those that want to educate themself like me getting my accociate degree. Buti cant afford every class nor when i get out will i have much to start over on. Right now they act racist agaist certain cases for what to not let them be able to have a chance in life. Some cases like mine if they had investigated at the first i wouldnt be here now.

So i signed the proposed deal, and little did i know that to get off of probation i was going to have to attend a sleugh of classes (among other things) and the cheepest class amounted to somewhere in the $20.00 a week range for almost a year and the most expensive cost almost $50.00 a week for 52 weeks not "
More interested,"  I never really cared about politics while I was a free man, but being in prison has opened my eyes to the reallities of the world.
  The world does not really care about those they put in prison, if the courts say we are guilty, then the courts must be right, then we are viewed and treated as such.
  So, when we try to do things the right way, the world treats us like we are scum of the earth.
  Politics, is just another word for greed. The government do not care about U.S.A. they only care about the money going to their pockets and looking like they are changing the world.
  They talk about being a strong country, yet the reallity of that is fake. We have more enemies then friends, and we waste military resources on petty wars that have nothing to do with us, still, I would fight for my family, if ever given the chance.

I was too wrapped up in using substances to dull my emotonal pain from childhood trauma to worry about having political views or being civic-minded.  Now, though, after 23 years in prison, I realize how greatly I'm affected by the laws and the political climate.  I have spent years as a Paralegal (from a Blackstone Legal Assistant certification) researching the law and standing up for civil liberties of incarcerated men like myself.  I have a case in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals number 19-1995 challenging Arkansas' use of unpaid prisoner labor as unconstitutional because 45 (or 48 depending on the source) other states pay their prisoners for labor.  I also have a lawsuit challenging the prison mail policy as violative of the Arkansas Constitution's equivalent of the 1st Amendment.
